## Step 1: Set Up an AWS EC2 Instance

1. **Launch an EC2 Instance:**
   - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Click on "Launch Instances."
   - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) based on your preferences (e.g., Ubuntu Server).
   - Select an instance type based on your needs.
   - Configure instance details, including the number of instances, network settings, and subnet.
   - Add storage and specify the size of the root volume.
   - Configure security groups to allow inbound traffic for SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443).
   - Review and launch the instance.
   - Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair to secure SSH access to the instance.
   - Launch the instance.

2. **Configure SSH Access:**
   - If you don't already have an SSH key pair, generate one locally:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
     ```
   - Copy the public key to your clipboard:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```
   - Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH and add your public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:
     ```bash
     ssh -i path/to/your/private/key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip
     echo "your-public-key" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```
   - Secure the SSH directory and authorized_keys file:
     ```bash
     chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```

3. **Record EC2 Instance Details:**
   - Make note of the public IP address or public DNS name of your EC2 instance. This will be used in later steps.

## Step 2: Install and Configure Required Software on the EC2 Instance

1. **Connect to Your EC2 Instance:**

   ```bash
   ssh -i path/to/your/private/key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip

## Step 2: Install and Configure Required Software on the EC2 Instance

1. **Connect to Your EC2 Instance:**

   ```bash
   ssh -i path/to/your/private/key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip
Update and Upgrade Packages:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```
Install Nginx:

```bash
sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1.12 -y
```
Start and Enable Nginx:
```
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```
Install MySQL:
```
sudo yum install mysql-server -y
Start and Enable MySQL:
```
```
sudo systemctl start mysqld
sudo systemctl enable mysqld
```
Run MySQL Secure Installation:

```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
Install PHP:

```
sudo amazon-linux-extras install php7.4 -y
```
Install Required PHP Extensions:
```
sudo yum install php-mysqlnd php-fpm php-json php-gd php-mbstring -y
```
Start and Enable PHP-FPM:
```
sudo systemctl start php-fpm
sudo systemctl enable php-fpm
```
Install Certbot for Let's Encrypt:
```
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
sudo yum install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
```
Record MySQL Passwords:
```
MySQL Root Password: You set this during the MySQL Secure Installation step.
WordPress MySQL User Password: You'll use this when configuring WordPress later.

## Step 3: Configure the WordPress Site and GitHub Actions

1. **Clone Your Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo

Modify Configuration Files:

Update nginx-config.conf to match your domain.
Customize setup-script.sh as needed.
Set Up GitHub Repository Secrets:

Create the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: Private key for SSH access to the EC2 instance.
EC2_INSTANCE_IP: Public IP address of your EC2 instance.
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: Root password for MySQL.
MYSQL_WORDPRESS_PASSWORD: Password for the WordPress MySQL user.
Configure the GitHub Actions Pipeline:

Open .github/workflows/main.yml.
Adjust the pipeline configuration as needed.
Push Changes to Your GitHub Repository:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Update configuration"
git push origin main
## Step 4: SSL/TLS Setup with Let's Encrypt
Connect to Your EC2 Instance:
```
ssh -i path/to/your/private/key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip
Install SSL/TLS Certificates Using Certbot:
```
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com -d www.your-domain.com
```
## Follow Certbot Prompts:
```
Choose whether to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
Certbot will automatically configure Nginx to use the SSL/TLS certificates.
```

## Step 5: Security Considerations

```
Regularly update software, including the server, WordPress, plugins, and packages.
Implement strong SSH access controls and disable root login.
Use a firewall (e.g., AWS Security Groups) to restrict incoming traffic.
Implement security plugins for WordPress (e.g., Wordfence, Sucuri).
Set up regular backups and test restoration procedures.
Step 6: Maintenance and Best Practices
Monitor server and website health using monitoring tools.
Regularly review server logs for unusual activities.
Implement a robust backup strategy for both files and databases.
Document your setup, configurations, and procedures.
